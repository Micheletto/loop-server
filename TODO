[Rooms]

- Do we want to have a default value for some parameters on POST /rooms
- We should add CORs handling and test it.
- Ask what the default configuration should be, with hints from us.
- Client max size shouldn't be needed by default.
- It's not a 200 it's a 201 on resource creation.
- What should be the size of the room token.

(not directly related, but still)

- webappUrl and a bunch of config related to calls should go in calls.*
